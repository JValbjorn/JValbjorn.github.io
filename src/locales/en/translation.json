  "CoilBotDescription": "This is Coilbot. He is a fun little game made for our student trip to the Netherlands. We were tasked with creating a fun interactive experience for the other students to try.\n\nCoilbot puts on a show, wears a disguise, and will give you a variety of fun tasks to complete. (Some of the tasks require real props to complete.) Will you manage to defeat him by completing enough tasks? Fail too many, and Coilbot will be victorious.\n\nMade in collaboration with classmates.\n\nThis project is made with:\nHTML, CSS, JavaScript",
  "ModerkagensMissionTitle": "Missions of the Placenta",
  "ModerkagensMissionDescription": "Missions of the Placenta was my 2nd-term exam project. It’s a gamification of the most important jobs the placenta does to keep the baby safe.\n\nThe project was made for the science museum STENO’s new exhibition “The Overseen Body”. We had to make a difficult topic fun and engaging for a younger audience.\n\nWe achieved this by gamifying the topic, so we could meet our audience where their interests were when visiting a museum. We also put a strong focus on making sure it didn’t become too graphic or disturbing for young visitors. That’s why we chose an animated style.\n\nMade in collaboration with classmates and STENO.\nThis project was made to fit a big screen, so to view it properly I recommend inspecting (F12) when viewing the site, and setting the resolution to 1000X1600.\n\nThis project is made with:\nHTML, CSS, JavaScript",
  "ZeroBuzzBrewTitle": "Zero Buzz Brew",
  "ZeroBuzzBrewDescription": "For this project, I focused on the design, 3D models of the cans, and the animation, since these were my main tasks.\nWe had to design a new brand and a variant of an alcohol-free beer. We came up with a range of fruity flavors, where each variant had its own unique color combinations that still represented the fruit flavors.\n\n To make the website feel like it was showcasing a real product, I explored Adobe Dimension to create 3D models of how the final cans would look. I also created a small animation for the hero section to show off all the flavors.\n\nMade in collaboration with classmates.\n\nThis project is made with:\nHTML, CSS, JavaScript",
  "MusicSyncTitle": "Music Sync",
  "MusicSyncDescription": "//WORK IN PROGRESS//\n\nThis is a small passion project I am making in my spare time.\nIts purpose is to help easily synchronize music from Spotify onto a music library.\nThere we can organize and categorize the music and transfer it back to Spotify in playlists when we need to teach dance classes.\n\nMade in collaboration with Oliver (github: oliv0533)\n\nThis project is made with: Typescript, CSS",
